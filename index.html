                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>We opened our doors in 1989 when Yaya Centre Mall first opened its doors to the Public and have remained open ever since.

                        Over the years we have served numerous of clients from different parts of the world, who have not failed to recommend their friends to visit us  when in this region.</p>
                        <p>Initially 1738 had specialised in Caucasian hair and had six hairdressers from six diff countries who worked for more than ten years. Gradually with growing populace on this side of town, it gradually moved to other types of hair: Afro, Asian and others. During this period the six hair dressers managed a skills transfer process to Kenyan hairdressers who now run the show.


                            The salon believes in continuous  learning and always organizes training and seminars for its staff to keep them relevant and up to date with market trends.</p>
